You know? I am so happy now, because I just finish the config of the hexo in Linux. I spent 2 days working for it, however I failed one time and one time.The sudupid machine always talk someings like I don't have permission to do that, and the github don't access my requests. But, you know,I am a so clever boy, and I can figure it in quickly.I am so happy. Byebye, the supid Operation System windows and Linux.
